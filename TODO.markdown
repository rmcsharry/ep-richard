# To do

- Figure out the 'next game released' code
- Work on a very basic design for the comments list page

Before merging:

- Look through all the commits in this branch before merging
- Send the first batch only to hello@easypeasy and bsafwat@gmail and check before sending out for real
- So send out manually for the first week or two
